## Teaching Experience:

Teaching Fellow CS 210, Computer Systems
Introduced students to data representations, assembly programming, caching, virtual memory etc.

Teaching Fellow CS/MA 109 Quantitative Analysis: 
Taught 4 discussion sections weekly. Assisted with grading.

Course Assistant CS 591 Programmable Smart Machines: 
Advised students' selection of research topics and oversaw some of their experiments with our group's Automatically Scalable Computation system. Lead discussions related to my research.

Assisted Undergrad researchers including Yara Awad, Craig Einstein, and Andrew Filippi in designing & carrying out experiments with the ASC system.

## Undergrad Research, B.U.:

Programmable Smart Machines Lab, Computer Science: 
Contributed to the Automatically Scalable Computation project. 
Advisor: Jonathan Appavoo

MuSun Physics: 
Built, tested, and repaired high speed hardware for a precision particle physics experiment. Advisor: Robert Carey

## Summer Internships:

Software Engineer, Morphotrust Biometric Security, summer 2014: 
Independently built a prototype Artificial Neural Network based passport classification system. Built a tool with a GUI front end for merging passport data from various sources into a unified database.


## Invited Talks:  
New Directions in Forensic Anthropology: Machine Learning Techniques. Advances in Forensic Sciences Forensic Sciences Symposium. April 10, 2015. I gave a talk alongside B.U. Archaeology professor Jon Bethard, from the department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. I presented a classification system I built that uses measurements of human skeletal remains to estimate the sex of the specimen. The system is competitive with expert classification.

## Outreach:
Lowell High School Robotics Club fall 2016:
Introduced students to principles of machine learning, how I apply it in my work, and how they might use it in theirs. 

Soldering Activity, Artemis, fall 2013: 
Assisted staff from the B.U. Electronics Design Facility in teaching 20 Boston area middle school girls the basics of soldering.
